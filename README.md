# Testing Angular

This is a simple Angular's example of use, created following [this Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-en-frameworks-javascript-aprende-angular-react-vue-js/).

As a backend, [this code](https://github.com/rdgonzu/node-rest-api) is needed.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
